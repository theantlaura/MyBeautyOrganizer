		<p>Here is the MBO review of the Kat Vod D Shade + Light Glimmer eyeshadow palette released in July 2017.
        This is a limited edition palette meant as an accompanient to the original Shade + Light eyeshadow
        palette.  I fell in love with it after I discovered the shimmer shades make excellent highlighters.  Watch for
        the full review.  Swatches are on primed skin and with a brush - just like eyeshadow would be applied to the lid.</p>
